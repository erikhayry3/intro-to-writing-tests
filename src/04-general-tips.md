# Tips for writing tests

- **Always make sure your test fails**
- Test one thing per test (writing 'and' in your test name is a hint that you are testing more than one thing)
- Group your tests with `describe`
- Split up your tests in multiple files if they get too big
- Don't be afraid to refactor your tests, throw away tests if you feel they are overlapping or not needed
- All the rules for writing good code applies to tests as well (DRY, KISS, etc.)
